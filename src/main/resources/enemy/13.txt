ABOUT THE MONSTERS:

Bandit Siren:
Sirens are well-known for their ability to draw sailors off course, running their ships aground. For most Sirens, this is simply accidental. This sea dweller has developed a taste for gold, using her special skills to become the third most feared pirate in the ocean.

Beetle Rider:
The volcanic caves of Mau Tari have been endowed with an enchantment that subverts the Inverse Square Law. Here goblins breed giant beetles to ride into battle.

Bluk Bluk:
Goblins spend their entire lives in the dark, so appearances don't matter much to them. Nowhere is this more apparent than their chickens. Bluk Bluks are cranky, ugly, and have far more teeth than most poultry.

Chemboy:
Once upon a time, an alchemist, thoroughly jacked up on his own supply, accidentally imbued his glassware with life. Now they wander the land, ambushing travellers with random status effect attacks for their amusement.

Corrupted Seraphim:
The Paladins of the Northern Mountains build these devices to keep the land safe from monsters and demons. Unfortunately they turned out to be incredibly susceptible to Biomech Blight, giving them both a curse of flesh, and a monster soul.

Crow Tank:
A Gnomish invention, and an excellent illustration of the adage: "Don't kick a Gnome, or he'll come back later with his friends and burn your house to the ground." Its powerful flame breath can level a forest in a matter of days, and a village in a matter of hours. We can only hope they're rare.

Flightless Sunbird:
Visitors from another world, Sunbirds hold a monopoly on the Stardust Ship lines, partially through shrewd business maneuvering, partly because they brought the Stardust Ships to our world, and partly because they're the only creatures who don't liquify when brought to lightspeed. They're also jerks. Every last one of them.

Golem:
This poor clod (heh) has to do whatever he's told. Unfortunately once you give a golem an instruction, the only way to remove it is for the task to complete. Give a golem an open-ended instruction like "Don't let anyone through that door!" and now that Golem is useless for anything else.

Jade Soldier:
Native to Mau Tari, Jade ants are known for their translucent, nigh indestructible carapaces, their elaborate, lavishly decorated colonies, and their ruthlessly efficient, six-foot-tall soldiers. One Jade Soldier is said to be able to take on twenty times her weight in combat, and hundreds of them live in a colony. Fortunately for the world, the Jade Ants are only interested in protecting their own land.

Jellypus:
A lighter-than-air cephalopod, far more intelligent than a Jellyfish. These float in wait over doors and around corners, tangling unwary folk in their tentacles, before eating them, alive, over a span of weeks.

Malfunctioning Snuggler:
These mechanical toys are the first item the Tinker's Guild ever sold to the general population. They are also their first recall. Designed to protect children from Bogeymen too smart to be fooled by a standard stuffed bear, these instead turned feral the instant the lights went out, attacking their owners and running off into the woods.

Owlbat:
Neither owls, nor bats, these are actually Hellspawn whose ancestors forgot the Open Hellgate spell, and decided to make a life for themselves above ground. They grind off their horns as juveniles, to prevent spontaneous combustion, which is their only remaining demonic magic.

Royal Mimic:
Your average Mimic is a sort of bottom feeder: Waiting in the dark for a hand to be shoved in their mouth. The Royal Mimic on the other hand, has higher ambitions, and will remain dormant for centuries, until placed on the head of a sufficiently powerful human, who it then consumes and replaces.

Splash Elemental:
When asked "Don't you mean 'Water Elemental'?" a Splash Elemental will launch a cup of water at your face and fly off. like Toast Elementals, these fairies are common in Kitchens around the world, primarily as dishwashers. 

Teratoma:
Most people have one or more of these living inside them, generally harmless masses of skin and hair, with the occasional tooth or eyeball. Much rarer are the bloodthirsty, sentient variety.

Toxic Podplant:
During spring and early summer, these make flight over the Warghead Swamp practically impossible. They're a pain to deal with at any time however. Being anywhere near one exposes you to the clouds of toxic pollen emanating from their flower, and of course, once you anger them, there's the jaws to worry about.

Unborn Terror:
The Deep King's children have been cursed to remain unhatched until his return. Even in this state, they terrorize the shorelines, blending in among the rocks, ambushing crowds in a mass of tentacles and ghastly mouths.

Vapor Knight:
Not strictly a ghost, this is Mirror Gas: A sentient cloud who watches and repeats the actions of the creatures who enter its cave. Unfortunately this one encountered a particularly violent Knight, and somehow got ahold of his mace.
