To enable this badge,  simply create an `OSSMETADATA` tagging file at the root of your GitHub repository containing a  single line similar to the following: `osslifecycle=active`. Other suggested values are  `osslifecycle=maintenance` and `osslifecycle=archived`. A working example  can be viewed on the [OSS Tracker repository](https://github.com/Netflix/osstracker).
